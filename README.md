Base Wordpress Theme

This is the base theme for use on Wordpress sites.  It comes pre-configured with two sidebars (left and right) and multiple page templates.

All custom styles should be added in custom.css, the default styles should be left alone and will be overridden.  Any
responsive styles can be added in responsive.css.

The site is fully responsive, and the container width can be set with 1 line of CSS in custom.css on the #page container.  

You can find additional layouts in the "extra layouts" folder inside the theme folder.  You can replace any of the page templates or single blog post templates with these files to quickly prototype the theme.

WP Pagination is included in the theme, and in the plugins directory to provide advanced paging functionality.  All archive pages (category, date, author, etc) are preconfigured to use this, along with the blog posts homepage file (home.php)
